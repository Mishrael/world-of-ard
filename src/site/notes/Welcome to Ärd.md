## Welcome to Ärd

For millennia, Ärd has seen the rise and fall of many kingdoms and powers. Each striving to achieve the grandeur and greatness of the kings of old -- to revitalize the Golden Age. Instead, all these efforts have brought strife upon the disparate peoples of Ärd, plunging the world into a veritable Dark Age of feuding kings and nobles. Every so often a king would arise to unite the world, but their efforts would be short lived and invariably leave the world more broken as a result. 

However, with the recent discovery of the world-wide rulers of Ärd from the Age of Myth, the Solannar, some have found hope for unified world and search for their secrets. There's only one issue, the Solannar reigned from the island continent known as The Stormlands, which is known as the deadliest place on Ärd. Little is known about the home of the Solannar as many have been wise enough to stay away, and still less known about the Solannar. But the search for knowledge has spurred nations into action, in a race to uncover the secrets of this enigmatic civilization.

With interest in the Stormlands rising day by day, and more and more braving the untamed wilds, both the Coalition of Free Realms and The Imperium Solis have found the land abundant in natural resources both from the earth itself and from the unique array of deadly fauna and flora, bringing economic interests to the forefront of the campaign to discover the secrets of these seemingly immaculate beings, the Solannar. 

Will you brave the wilds of the Stormlands?

> [!NOTE]- ## The Campaign
> The Campaign is set in the World of Ard, as you've no doubt observed, and you're part of the Coalition looking delving into the wilds of Eryndor, The Maelstrom Expanse, the Stormlands. You're seeking the keys to the past by searching for and evidence of the Solannar, and hopefully extract the any knowledge left behind. 
> To do so you'll have to brave the Expanse, a centralized continent that has been left alone for ages due to it's chaotic and brutal environs. You'll face deadly and unnatural fauna and flora; sudden and severe storms that will kill as certainly the beasts of the land; unpredictable magics and magical phenomenon; shifting landscapes; and of course, you're not alone in the hunt for Solannar wisdom and artefacts, the Imperium Solis who view all Solannar artefacts as their birthright.

> [!important]- ## What is a West Marches campaign?
> West Marches refers to a style of game play introduced by Ben Robbins almost two decades ago, now, named for the area in Robbins' world he was sending his players into. 
> The name, however, is not the important piece, it's what it represents. Most games of D&D, and most other ttrpgs, for that matter, rely heavily on the story to be provided and run by the GM. Not only this, but they generally hinge on the GM to schedule game nights and require that the stars align -- so to speak -- for all the players involved to be there. Compound all this with the fact that GMs are a rare breed, and many players are out there looking for games to join, and you have yourself and bit of a pickle. 
> This style of campaign seeks to alleviate most, if not all, of these stressors for our beloved game. 
> First, it allows for largely groups of players to be run by a single GM/DM. Mostly because you're not running all of the players, mostly because not all the players could meet at the same time. What this turns into, is a very low-commiment game. Players show up when they can. 
> Second, because the setting of such campaigns is so open ended, it relies on the players to drive the story forward. So the players get exactly what they want out of the game, and GM/DM is the one responding to the players, not the other way around. This gives the players an intrinsic sense of agency in crafting the world they play in.

> [!Important]- ## Details
> We meet at the Ellensburg Foursquare Church inside the Fireside room every 3rd Sunday @ 4pm. Food is usually provided, though some weeks it might just be snacks.
> You'll want to join the Discord, too: https://discord.gg/EyWAhRWn 
> We'll do most of of our organizing over the Discord, and we plan on expanding beyond a D&D campaign when there's enough interest for it.
