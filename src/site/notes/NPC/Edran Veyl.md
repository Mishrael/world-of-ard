### **The Battle-Worn Idealist**

- **Name**: **Edran Veyl**
- **Background**: Once a soldier in the Imperium, Edran defected after witnessing their atrocities. He now channels his experience into training Coalition recruits.
- **Personality**: Charismatic and jocular, he believes in inspiring recruits by fostering camaraderie in the ranks. Only, sometimes, that means a joke or two at someone's expense.
- **Approach**: Edran mixes rigorous combat training with lighthearted wit, ensuring recruits understand the stakes of their mission, but don't take themselves too seriously.
