## **Anessa Veyan – The Arcane Tempest**

_"Power flows like the tide—unpredictable, unrelenting, and in the wrong hands, catastrophic."_

- **Race:** High Elf
- **Age:** Over 200 years old
- **Affiliation:** Maelstrom Hold
- **Titles:** Archmage of the Maelstrom, Keeper of The Vault
- **Notable Traits:** Frontier arcanist, unorthodox in magic and warfare

### **Overview**

Anessa Veyan is **not your typical archmage**. While most **high-ranking spellcasters** remain **in their towers**, she has spent the last **century at the edge of the world**, where magic is **as unpredictable as the storms that batter the Hold.**

She sees **Eryndor not just as a place of danger, but of immense arcane potential**. The unstable **ley lines, the ancient ruins buried in the jungle, and the unknown magical forces lurking beneath the land**—these are mysteries **she is determined to unravel**.

While she is **loyal to the Coalition**, she views **Maelstrom Hold as something greater than a mere military outpost**—she believes it is **a key to understanding the forgotten magic of Ärd.**

### **Skills & Capabilities**

- **Head Researcher** – Anessa has full command of The Vault, the Solannar ruin that Maelstrom Hold surrounds and protects, and in turn uses this Vault to protect the Hold.   
- **Leywalker of the Unknown** – Can **sense and navigate arcane anomalies**, making her **one of the few mages able to survive in Eryndor’s wild magic zones**.  
- **Unorthodox Magecraft** – While an archmage, indeed, hailing from the storied halls of Talyssar's premier academy, she has garnered a reputation for collecting unusual spells, which she uses to great effect. 

### **Reputation & Influence**

- **Respected among Coalition mages**, but some **view her as reckless for experimenting with unstable magic.**
- **A figure of awe and fear within the Hold**, as her spells have **both saved lives and reshaped the very land itself.**
