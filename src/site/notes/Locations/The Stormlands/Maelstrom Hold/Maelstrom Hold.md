The Coalition foothold in **Eryndor**, is run by Daryn Altas and Anessa Vayen. Commander Altas oversees the military efforts of protecting the Hold, while Head Scholar Vayen organizes and oversees research of the Solannar artefacts and other curious magical items. 

#### **Location**:

- **Terrain**: The Hold would be built in a defensible and covert location.
    - Surrounded by Marshes and Rainforst; hemmed in by mountains.
    - Co-opting a ruined Solannar structure near the cost.

#### **Layout**:

1. **Outer Defenses**:
    
    - **Watchtowers**: Equipped with signaling systems such as mirrors, flags, or magical flares to warn of incoming threats.
    - **Barriers**: Simple wooden palisades and ditches.
    
2. **Inner Structures**:
    
    - **Command Center**: A central wooden building in the courtyard of the Solannar structure. The structure itself is buried, and has several chambers that locked by doors either shut from age or damage, or magically sealed. 
    - **Barracks and Quarters**: Shelters built from local materials or modular structures transported to the site.
    - **Armory and Supply Depot**: Secure areas for storing weapons, magical items, and rations, including supplies for enduring Eryndor’s harsh conditions.
    
3. **Specialized Areas**:
    
    - **Research Pavilion**: A sheltered area where Coalition scholars and mages analyze Solannar artifacts and ruins.
    - **Healers’ Ward**: Staffed by medics and herbalists familiar with Eryndor’s unique flora for creating antidotes and poultices.

### **Personnel at the Outpost**

4. **Leadership**:
    
    - **Commander Daryn Altas**: A no-nonsense tactician coordinating military operations and ensuring the Hold’s security.
    - **Scholar Anessa Vayen**: A mage specializing in Solannar relics, overseeing the research pavilion.
5. **Specialists**:
    
    - **Scouts and Rangers**: Experts in navigating Eryndor’s chaotic terrain, gathering intelligence on Imperium movements.
    - **Healers and Alchemists**: Skilled in treating injuries and concocting antidotes for Eryndor’s venomous flora and fauna.
6. **Support Staff**:
    
    - Cooks, quartermasters, and engineers keep the base running smoothly despite limited resources.

### **Challenges at the Hold**

7. **Eryndor’s Chaos**:
    
    - Frequent storms, magical disruptions, and shifting terrain make maintaining the base a constant challenge.
    - Supplies are difficult to transport, and expeditions often return with casualties from the environment as much as from enemy encounters.
8. **Imperium Pressure**:
    
    - The Hold is constantly at risk of discovery by the Imperium, requiring tight operational security.
    - Spies or traitors among Coalition personnel add tension to the already precarious situation.
9. **Artifact Risks**:
    
    - Solannar relics studied at the Hold might have unpredictable effects, from subtle distortions in reality to sudden magical explosions.
    - Researchers must carefully balance curiosity with caution, as mistakes could compromise the base’s safety.

### **Key Features**

10. **Solannar Relic Integration**:
    
    - A partially intact Solannar artifact, discovered near the Hold, provides the distinct advantage of shielding the base from storms and boosting magical communication. However, it is not stable and requires nearly constant troubleshooting.
11. **Coalition Unity**:
    
    - Personnel at the Hold represent a mix of cultures from across the Coalition, with occasional clashes of tradition or strategy. This diversity is both a strength and a source of tension.
12. **Covert Missions**:
    
    - From the Hold, the Coalition launches reconnaissance missions, sabotage efforts, and artifact recovery expeditions deep into Eryndor. Success often depends on speed, stealth, and ingenuity. The Longest expedition into the Maelstrom Expanse, was two months, and only one adventurer survived this mission, which was a seemingly simple survey mission. However, it has given the leadership of the hold much needed insights into the unknown terrain of central Eryndor, hopefully.
