For millennia, Ärd has seen the rise and fall of many kingdoms and powers. Each striving to achieve the grandeur and greatness of the kings of old -- to revitalize the Golden Age. Instead, all these efforts have brought strife upon the disparate peoples of Ärd, plunging the world into a veritable Dark Age of feuding kings and nobles. Every so often there would be a king that would rise to unite the world, but their efforts would be short lived and invariably leave the world more broken as a result. 

However, coming from humble beginnings, and steadily expanding their influence over 500 years or so, from the small river region of Thalvarin, the Solis established a rule of order amidst chaos, harsh though they might have been. With and organized kingdom and a strong military, the Solis became the Imperium Solis, and waged a campaign of conquest across the western world, dominating and subjugating much of what they've set out to possess over the next 300 years.

Such growth breeds adversity, and the Coalition of Free Realms holds the line in trying to reign in the empire. The Coalition, strung together in an alliance of broken nations and peoples, many from nations that have been conquered by the Imperium, that seek ways to fight back against the empire. 

Now at the Imperium's height of power, and stretched thin across grand distances, the Imperium reached an impasse of sorts, only to be reinvigorated by the world shaking discovery of a world-spanning kingdom from the Age of Myth, the Solannar, scholars call them. With this news, the Imperium Solis has adopted the view that they are heirs of the Solannar, and the world is their birthright, and, thus, the delve into the homeland of the Solannar, Lyscaris, or Eryndor if you're from the Coalition, to find the power their ancestors had to bring the whole world under the dominion of one. 

For the Coalition, these Solannar are seen in drastically different light, seen as protectors or guardians that have mysteriously vanished, or are hidden. So, they delve into the Maelstrom Expanse as well, to find the means to stave off the power hungry Solis.
