- **Government:** Decentralized Council of Elders
- **Culture:** Nature-worshiping, survivalist, hunter-gatherer societies
- **Key Exports:** Specialized wood, herbal medicines, tracking expertise
- **Military Strength:** Forest guerrilla fighters, elite archers, animal-bound scouts
- **Summary:** The Sylvani Confederacy consists of **forest clans and druidic enclaves**, resisting both Imperial conquest and overreach by fellow Coalition members.
