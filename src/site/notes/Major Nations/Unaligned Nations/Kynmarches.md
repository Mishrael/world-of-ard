### **The Kynmarches (The Warden Clans)**

- **Government:** Loose confederation of warrior-kings
- **Culture:** Stoic, deeply superstitious, duty-bound
- **Key Exports:** Furs, direwolf mounts, ancient grimoires
- **Military Strength:** Border sentinels, monster-hunters, longbowmen
- **Summary:** A land of **cold marshes, frozen peaks, and deep forests**, the Kynmarches are home to old bloodlines sworn to **hunt the horrors that lurk beyond the known world**. Their warriors, the **Wardens**, are trained from youth to combat **ancient evils, frostborn beasts, and forgotten things that slither beneath the tundra.** The Imperium wants them **subjugated**, while the Coalition wants them **allied**—but the Kynmar won’t be easily swayed. They fight for their own reasons.
