## **Daryn Altos – The Stormforged General**

_"The storm does not break those who stand firm—it forges them."_

- **Race:** Human
- **Age:** Late 40s
- **Affiliation:** Maelstrom Hold
- **Titles:** Marshal-General of the Hold, Master of the Tempest Blades
- **Notable Traits:** Tactical mastermind, survival-driven leader, unyielding in crisis

### **Overview**

Daryn Altos is **the unshakable rock upon which Maelstrom Hold stands**. A **seasoned warrior and expert tactician**, he was once a **Coalition field commander** before volunteering to **lead the defense of the Hold**, a **harsh, isolated post** that many considered a **death sentence**.

Daryn’s battlefield experience is not just in **facing armies, but in surviving the untamed wilds of Eryndor**. He has spent **decades** ensuring the Hold **remains standing against the true threats of the frontier**—**deadly beasts, magical anomalies, and the ruthless storms that batter the coast.**

Unlike many Coalition officers, he does not view the **Imperium Solis as the primary danger**—he understands that the **wilderness itself is their greatest enemy**. However, he remains wary of **Imperial agents** seeking to **undermine the Hold from within**.

### **Skills & Capabilities**

**Frontier Warfare Expert** – Excels in **guerilla tactics, fortification strategies, and survival-based combat.**  
**Slayer’s Cunning** – A renown slayer and dragon-slayer, having been apart of three separate dragon encounters, two back on the mainland and one on Eryndor itself. He guides the hold knowing the dangers and outsmarting them to survive and bring us closer to the Coalition's goals here on the Stormlands.  
**Master of Adaptation** – Can **turn environmental hazards into advantages**, whether by **using a storm to mask movement** or **baiting a predator into an ambush**.  
**Warden’s Oath** – His personal code: _“No foothold shall be lost, no soldier abandoned.”_ Commander Altos is absolutely determined to see this initiative succeed, as he believes it will be the determining factor in succumbing to or defeating the Empire. 

### **Reputation & Influence**

- **Respected by the Hold’s officers**, but often seen as **overly pragmatic** by Coalition generals.
- **Feared by Imperials**, but not because of military strength—because **they know so little about him or how he operates.**
- **Revered by those who serve under him**, as he is **one of the few commanders who leads from the front, sharing the same hardships as his soldiers.**
