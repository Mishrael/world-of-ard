### **The Dune Kingdoms of Asmira (Keepers of the Sun’s Shadow)**

- **Government:** Holy Monarchs & Council of Sand Sages
- **Culture:** Ancient tomb-builders, scholars of lost empires, desert mystics
- **Key Exports:** Enchanted glass, lost relics, water-forging techniques
- **Military Strength:** Sand-walkers, bronze golem sentinels, mirage-weaving spellcasters
- **Summary:** Once a great empire, now a land of **ruins and shifting sands**, Asmira’s scholars dedicate themselves to uncovering the **truth of the lost ages.** Their **Sand Sages** claim the Stormlands hold relics **even older than the Solannar**, but the Imperium seeks to claim these discoveries first. The Asmirans are **traders, mystics, and tomb-guardians**, wary of both the Coalition and Imperium.
