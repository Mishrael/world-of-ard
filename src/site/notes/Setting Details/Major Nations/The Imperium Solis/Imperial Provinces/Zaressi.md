### **Zaressi (The Silent Dominion)**

- **Government:** Imperial Martial Law
	
- **Culture:** Recently conquered, strictly policed, politically volatile
	
- **Key Exports:** Tribute, forced labor, war slaves
	
- **Military Strength:** Occupation forces, auxiliary legions, informant networks
	
- **Summary:** The **most recent addition to the Imperium**, **Zaressi is a province under close watch**. Once a **proud and independent people**, the **Zaressians have been given a choice—assimilate into Imperial rule or be forgotten**. Unlike other provinces, which have fully adapted to Imperial law, **Zaressi is still under martial supervision**, with **Imperial governors working carefully to root out rebellious factions**. However, **rather than crushing the people with overwhelming force, the Imperium takes a calculated approach—firmly integrating them into its structure while ensuring that stability is never threatened**.
