The quality that suffuses Imperial culture is order. Everyone has their place and their purpose. Whether the purpose was chosen or not, people are put to use, and those that step out of line often find the consequences so severe they never do so again. 

This is not to say that citizens of the Imperium Solis are not ambitious or jockey for station and power, this is all too common, but it is understood that everything is to work for the glory of Her Radiant Majesty, Empress of the Sun and the station she embodies, The Golden Throne. Imperials are fanatic about their Empresses/Emperors, to the people at large, The Golden Throne is eternal like the sun and must persist into tomorrow. 

Due to this level of unity, the empire, though it often is sever with its punishments, and saddles it's people with purposes so that they might be useful to the empire, the Imperium experiences a level of prosperity rivalled only by the Coalition; their expansion only ceased for want of the numbers to hold any additional lands conquered; and the daily life of citizens is largely unaffected by the government so long as they abide by the rules. To many this is a good life -- a great life! And for many it is easy to see how good the empire is to its citizens and feel that they should be the ones to bring order and unity to the rest of the world.

This sense of nationalistic pride has only magnified in the last ten years of so, since the Empress's proclamation that the Solis are the heirs of the Solannar.
