### **Republic of Alzora (The Gilded Dominion)**

- **Government:** Oligarchic Republic (Ruled by the **Golden Concord**)
    
- **Culture:** Wealth-obsessed, status-driven, masters of finance
    
- **Key Exports:** Banking services, rare gems, exotic silks, legal expertise
    
- **Military Strength:** Wealth-funded mercenaries, elite duelist bodyguards, economic warfare
    
- **Summary:** **Alzora is the financial nerve center of the Coalition**, its wealth influencing kingdoms and battlefields alike. While it lacks the **raw naval power of Itheris** or the **covert influence of Delmaris**, Alzora **controls the flow of coin**, ensuring that armies are paid, supplies are bought, and wars are won before they even begin. The **Golden Concord**, an assembly of the wealthiest merchant families and banking houses, governs through **calculated investments and ruthless economic strategy**. Alzoran **moneylenders finance entire wars**, ensuring that even the most warlike nations **remain in their debt**. Their elite **duelist bodyguards, the Auric Blades**, are famed for their mastery of single combat, defending the honor—and fortunes—of their patrons. Though their influence comes through coin rather than conquest, they wield **economic power as effectively as any army**.
