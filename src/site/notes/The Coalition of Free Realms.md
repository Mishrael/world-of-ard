## The Coalition of Free Realms

The Coalition is an alliance of similarly minded nations, that have banded together to benefit and prosper one another about 200 years ago. It seemed that each nation had something the others could use and that by working together, while still sovreign states, they could benefit themselves and the whole. The Coalition is a bustling hub of cosmopolitanism, and have become not only an economic force in the world, but a center of arcane and scientific study. 

Once word arrive in their part of the world that the Imperium Solis was expanding so rapidly, their coalition also became a convenient safety in numbers type deal for it or when the Imperium decided to come after them. To fend off that fate, the Coalition has been treating with other people and nations in efforts to gain more and more support. And they've made more and more allies over the years, adding to their coalition, but unlike the harsh and often bloody acquisitions of the Imperium, the Coalition are only ever diplomatic in their acquisition of friends. 

Life in the Coalition is varied, and largely depends on your homeland. Itheri, are a coastal people and excellent seafarers; Corvanin are a tough and rugged people, disciplined and unyielding; Talyssians revel in their marvelous machinations of machine and magic; and so on. Each region, each city state, each tribe have their own ways of life and are open to the ways of their allies.
