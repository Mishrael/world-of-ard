### **Overview**

Wyl is the **quiet heart of Maelstrom Hold’s social life**, the unassuming bartender of [[Locations/The Stormlands/Maelstrom Hold/The Cantina\|The Cantina]]—the Hold’s most frequented social hub, known for its strong brews, bad decisions, and hushed conversations. Though awkward in speech and posture, with a **slightly froggy, squeaky voice** that catches new patrons off guard, Wyl is far more observant and sharp than he lets on.

He's a fixture of the Hold, someone who's been there **since its founding**. Rumors circulate that Wyl was once a **Coalition scout** who got too close to one of **Eryndor’s arcane anomalies**—many think something changed him out there, but if it did, Wyl never speaks of it.

Now, he watches from behind the bar, **listening to every conversation** that passes through his cantina. His awkward charm and subtle wit make him an **unexpected source of information**, and many believe he knows more about the **Hold’s politics, Imperial spies, and the dangers of Eryndor** than any soldier on the front lines.
