### **The Dominion of Skadrith (The Northern Raiders)**

- **Government:** Warrior Clans
- **Culture:** Cold-blooded pragmatism, raiding culture, mercenary work
- **Key Exports:** Ships, warriors-for-hire, black market goods
- **Military Strength:** Amphibious raids, berserker warriors, high-seas piracy
- **Summary:** The Dominion controls the frozen north, where only the strongest survive. While they are **officially neutral**, their mercenaries fight for both the Coalition and the Imperiumâ€”**whoever pays more.** They see the Stormlands as just another battlefield where the weak will die and the strong will take what they want.
