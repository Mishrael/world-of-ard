### **The Suthrlands (Lords of Ice and Fire)**

- **Government:** Hereditary warlords & mountain holds
- **Culture:** Blood feuds, honor codes, fire-worshiping zealots
- **Key Exports:** Volcanic glass, warhounds, masterwork spears
- **Military Strength:** Shield walls, fire-dancers, mountain cavalry
- **Summary:** A land of **snow-capped peaks and smoldering volcanoes**, where clans carve out their domains with steel and flame. The **Cult of the Last Flame** rules the landâ€™s **religion and prophecy**, claiming that only through fire can one be cleansed. The Imperium **sees them as heretics**, the Coalition **sees them as too volatile**, but **no one denies the strength of Suthrlander warriors.** They see the Stormlands as a proving ground for the worthy.
