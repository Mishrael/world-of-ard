"Cantina" is roughly carved into a piece of drift wood nailed to the hull of what used to be the proud Squalbreaker. 

The cantina is **small but lively**, carved from the bones of an **old Coalition supply ship** that ran aground during the Hold’s early days. The walls are adorned with **trophies of Maelstrom Hold’s history**—beast claws, worn banners, and old scout equipment.

- **Signature Drink:** _The Squall Breaker_ – A brutal, spicy liquor that **“warms your bones or burns through your regrets.”**
- **Patron Favorites:** The cantina attracts **veteran scouts, off-duty guards, and explorers** returning from the jungle—making it a hotbed for **information**.
