- **Summary:** Talyssar is the **foremost magical power** in the Coalition, home to **Arcane laboratories and world-class mage academies.** Ruled by the **Circle of Arcanists**, the city-state supplies **battle-mages, enchanted arms, and strategic arcane intelligence.** They maintain an uneasy alliance with the warrior-nations, wary of those who might fear or suppress magic. The **Imperium sees them as dangerous heretics**, making them prime targets in the war.
