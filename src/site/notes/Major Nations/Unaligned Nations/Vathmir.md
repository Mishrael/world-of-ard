### **The Kingdom of Vathmir (The Dying Land)**

- **Government:** Dying Monarchy
- **Culture:** Hauntingly tragic, duty-bound, whispers of undeath
- **Key Exports:** Cursed artifacts, ghostly relics, black iron
- **Military Strength:** Last remnants of a once-mighty army
- **Summary:** Once a mighty kingdom, Vathmir fell to a **plague of undeath** decades ago. Now, its last ruler, **King Malrik the Undying**, holds his kingdom together through sheer will. Though he refuses to acknowledge it, the land is doomedâ€”its people fading away, its warriors becoming shades of their former selves. The Imperium calls Vathmir an **abomination**, while the Coalition debates whether to offer aid or let it fade into the past.
